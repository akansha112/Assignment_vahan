Create a basic android application using native technologies (Java or Kotlin) which displays a list of universities around the world. Use http://universities.hipolabs.com/search API to get this list and show university name, country and website, in each row. Website field should be a clickable link which should open an in-app webview when clicked. Also write a service which will keep refreshing data from the API every 10 seconds. It should refresh the list even if I minimise the app or exit it (hint: use foreground service).

Architecture : MVVM
Language Used : Kotlin
API Call: Retrofit
Service Call: Foreground Service
